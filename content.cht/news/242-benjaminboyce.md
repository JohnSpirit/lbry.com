## [Benjamin Boyce](https://open.lbry.com/@BenjaminABoyce:2) is a journalist, cultural critic, and interviewer of interesting people.

Boyce rose to public attention when he covered upheaval, unrest, and national scandal at his alma mater, Evergreen State College. This work culminated in [The Complete Evergreen Story](https://open.lbry.com/@BenjaminABoyce:2/the-complete-evergreen-story-1:3) a fascinating and disquisitive look at a uniquely modern series of events.

Boyce went on to find his voice, a choice that turned out pretty noyce. Here’s some we recommend:

- [Comedy is Dead](https://open.lbry.com/@BenjaminABoyce:2/comedy-is-dead-gadsby-hart-apple:d)
- [Posie Parker | No Country For Opinionated Women](https://open.lbry.com/@BenjaminABoyce:2/posie-parker-no-country-for-opinionated:b)
- [State of Debate: A Counterpoint](https://lbry.tv/@BenjaminABoyce:2/state-of-debate-a-counterpoint-with:7) vs. [his interview with Michael Moreno](https://lbry.tv/@BenjaminABoyce:2/truth-vs-persuasion-with-michael-moreno:1) ([previously](https://lbry.com/news/moreno))

Evidently, speaking up for truth, reason, and open and free debate makes one part of the intellectual underground. We’re not going to claim we understand it, but we can say welcome Benjamin to LBRY and [encourage you to follow him today](https://open.lbry.com/@BenjaminABoyce:2).
