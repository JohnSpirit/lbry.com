I DO NOT PARTICIPATE IN PAID REVIEWS OR PROMOTIONS

This sentence begins Crypto Tips channel profile as well as accompanying videos.


It’s the first clue to what you’re in for: fun, honest, and informative videos about crypto, tech, and travel.

This is going to get kind of nerdy. So before we go there, let’s drop some links for those who are ready to check it out:

- [Meet the First Bitcoiners](https://lbry.tv/@Crypto-Tips:b/meet-the-real-first-bitcoiners:9)
- [How to Easily Secure Your Favorite Cryptos](https://lbry.tv/@Crypto-Tips:b/how-to-easily-secure-your-favorite:1)
- [How Blockchain is Becoming the New Scam](https://lbry.tv/@Crypto-Tips:b/5-signs-a-coin-will-survive-in-the-long:a)

OK, let’s get econ nerdy.

There’s this famous Nobel-prize winning paper called the Market for Lemons by this dude named George Akerlof. Reductively, it goes like this: 

If a market has substantial “information-asymmetry” (sellers know a lot more about the good than buyers -- think used cars), it will come to be dominated by lemons (bad cars).

This is the exact situation the crypto markets are in. It’s tough for the average person to understand whether abstract, grand, and technically-complicated claims are reality or fabricated. Bad products, which are easy to manufacture, risk ruining the market for good ones, both because they can be produced cheaply and they drive buyers out of the market.

One of the ways this _problem is solved is by people like Heidi_ from Crypto Tips. Heidi reduces information asymmetry, and helps people sort the good from the bad.

Be like Heidi. Or at least subscribe to [@Crypto Tips.](http://open.lbry.com/@Crypto-Tips)
