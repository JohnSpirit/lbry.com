Today we’re excited to announce two new rewards for LBRY creators: one for followers, and one for views. Also, [YouTube Partner program](#youtube) users can now claim monthly rewards if they qualify.

## Follower rewards
Starting with your very first follower and at ascending tiers, you receive LBC rewards.

These rewards are immediately claimable from your Rewards area. You’ll also receive an email notification when you hit various tiers.

To see the exact reward tiers, check out the updated [Rewards FAQ](https://lbry.com/faq/rewards#followers).

## View rewards
Creators will earn additional rewards based on the views to their content.

Every signed in user with a verified lbry.tv account will automatically tip the first 10 pieces of content they access each day.

As a creator, these show up in your [Transactions area](https://lbry.tv/$/transactions). Note that because these come in as tips, these will *not* show in your available balance unless unlocked. You can read more about this in the [Tipping and Supports FAQ](https://lbry.com/faq/tipping). We anticipate more improvements to this process in the near future.

## YouTube Program improvements {#youtube}
Our [YouTube Partner program](https://lbry.com/youtube), which allows YouTube creators to seamlessly publish to LBRY and earn rewards, is getting two great changes:

1. Rewards will now be granted monthly instead of yearly. Starting literally right *now*, all creators are eligible to claim these immediately, even if you just received your yearly reward. You will receive a notification when these are available, and you will never lose anything by waiting to claim (for example, if you miss a month, two months will be available on next login).

2. Videos will start syncing faster. Rather than up to 24 hours or longer, we are targeting sub-hour times, with some bias towards more popular channels. This change is still a few days to a few weeks from being rolled out completely.
