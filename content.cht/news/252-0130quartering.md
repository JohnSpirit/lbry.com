## The Quartering talks video games, movies, comics, and culture. At last, a break from all the politics?

![The Quartering](https://spee.ch/@lbrynews:0/quartering.jpeg)

Video games. Comics. Movies. The enjoyable entertainment we consume after a long day at work, free from the day-to-day drama of the real world.

No.

No, stop.

We have to fight about this sh*t now too?

I’ve learned three things this week:

1. We are indeed fighting about these things.
2. The Quartering provides a pretty frickin funny and informative take on this stuff.
3. You should not watch the Quartering if you are prone to beard envy.
