### Coming hot on the heels of Erikson, the new LBRY Franklin takes the hard work we put into discovery and puts it to use to deliver the best yet incarnation of the LBRY app.

Franklin has some awesome, long -awaited features like:
* **A new video player.** We've overhauled the native video player in the app for smoother performance and better functionality.
* **Popout functionality on videos.** Want to keep browsing while you're watching? No problem! You can now pop out the video player to listen and watch while you explore LBRY.
* **Channel blocking.** Sick of seeing a certain channel (or three)? You can customize your LBRY experience by blocking channels you don't want to watch so they never darken your electronic doorstep again.
* **And much, much more!**
 
So open your app now to upgrade - and if you havenâ€™t installed it yet, what are you waiting for? [Click here to get it now](https://lbry.com/get), or open your app to upgrade!
