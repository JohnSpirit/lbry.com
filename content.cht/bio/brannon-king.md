Brannon King merges talent, precision, and prudence with experience and a passion for simplicity.

Prior to becoming a blockchain engineer, Brannon developed autonomous driving software, primarily in C++ and C#. This included a lot of work in search algorithms, geometry, threading, and pub/sub frameworks.

In his spare time Brannon plays the piano, cares for his six children, and reads. In 2006 he was influenced heavily through a reading of the  _The Bastiat Collection_, which set him on a life course destined to intercept cryptocurrencies.
