We Are Change is an independent, non-partisan news organization that seeks to find and and uncover the stories the mainstream media does not.

### Visiting Epstein’s Island

If you want an example of their coverage style, check out their coverage of Jeffery Epstein’s private island. We Are Change wanted to learn more about it, so they did the most direct and logical thing: they just went there.

### Virginia Gun Protests

Going on the ground to get a first-hand, in-person look and see how things really are is a central tenet of coverage at We Are Change. For a fresh example, check out their visit to Virginia Lobby Day.

Was Virginia Lobby Day full of violent Neo Nazis or a day of peaceful protest?

### How Did Senior Saudis’ Get Bezos’ Boy Bits?

While on the ground reporting is one of their more unique touches, We Are Change isn’t afraid to cover a story du jour. Especially if that story involves a foreign government obtaining private photos of one of the most powerful men in America.
