It’s been a while since you heard from us - but that's because we’ve been hard at work piecing together what just might be our biggest release yet! Just when you thought the ship might have run aground, the all new LBRY Erikson is coming over the horizon with a bounty of awesome features and fixes!

## Set Sail For Discovery!
LBRY Erikson makes discovery easier than ever - we’ve introduced a whole new way to navigate the LBRY app. Users can now follow tags based on their interests, and get recommendations based on those tags. You'll notice that the old home page is gone - and that's a good thing! From now on, users will see videos based on what they've said they're interested in.

## Some Loot For Creators
And you know what that means - a whole new suite of tools for LBRY’s MVPs, our wonderful creators! Channel owners can now edit their channel through the "publishes" page, and change the cover image, profile image, contact email, channel description, and title. If you have any questions about these new features, check out [our extensive FAQs](https://lbry.com/faq).

## We Didn’t Forget About Our Regular Users
If you’re a regular user who doesn’t upload content and are feeling a little jealous of all the love we’re giving to creators, we have some surprises for you as well! To make your lives a little better, we've:
* Implemented an alpha version of comments
* Added a stylish new set of buttons and themes throughout the app
* Replaced long claim IDs with short URLs to make them even easier to share
* Updated the sharing function in the app to share a beta.lbry.tv URL instead of a spee.ch URL

And if you’ve ever been confused by the sorting of content on the home page, let your confusion be gone! Content is now sorted by the time it was released, making it easier to catch up with the latest from your favorite creators.

## Why Erikson?
You may be wondering, “why Erikson?” Leif Erikson was a pioneer and explorer from a family of pioneers and explorers. His father, Erik the Red, was the founder of the first Norse settlement in Greenland (not exactly a hospitable place), and Leif carried on the tradition, pushing ever Westward. Beating Columbus by about 500 years, Erikson was the first European to discover the New World - when he landed on his second expedition and found the land was full of grape vines growing wild, he named it Vinland.

Erikson was all about discovery, and so is this update! Just like Leif, we want our users to set sail on the decentralized seas and discover new, exciting ideas and concepts. So open your app and upgrade now, or [head to our website](https://LBRY.com/get) and get started - there’s a whole new world just waiting for you to discover it on LBRY.
