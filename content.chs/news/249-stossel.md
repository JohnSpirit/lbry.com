## [John Stossel](https://open.lbry.com/@johnstossel:7) produces an unusual, artisanal, almost extinct product: real news.

Sure, you’ll find the fake stuff. Or the real stuff, but cut with baking soda and Beyoncé facts. But raw, uncut, actual real-reporting? It’s nearly been eliminated.

John Stossel has been producing it for decades. First with CBS, later ABC’s 20/20 and Fox Business, and currently Reason magazine (plus other stuff, the dude has made a lot of news). 

With so many news manufactures moving on to ersatz alternatives, it’s been left to a small number of craftsmen like John Stossel to continue the production of this nearly extinct product.

LBRY first met John Stossel more than 2 years ago when [he covered an effort by the LBRY community](https://lbry.tv/@johnstossel:7/entrepreneur-saves-free-college-courses:2) to save more than 20,000 college lectures. A few weeks ago, [he announced](https://twitter.com/JohnStossel/status/1205208053148241931) he’d publishing all of his content to the network directly.

### If you’ve never watched John before, some great videos to start with are:
