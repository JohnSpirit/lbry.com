### In a nutshell, this upgrade brings you:
- A few new styles throughout the app - rounded edges are back! Also includes side bar tweaks. 
- Randomized suggested subscriptions	 
- Initial channel page implementation. Updates can only be made via the CLI currently: https://lbry.tech/api/sdk#channel_update (wallets across multiple PCs will need to be re-synced)
- Upgraded SDK to support new metadata. It's being captured on upload but not displayed yet. 
- SDK now supports viewing content without saving files or blobs, this release still has both enabled. We'll add options in future releases.

For all the details, you can [take a look at the release notes](https://github.com/lbryio/lbry-desktop/releases/tag/v0.32.0)
