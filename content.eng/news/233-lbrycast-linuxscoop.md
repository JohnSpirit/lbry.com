## 9 out of 10 free software breakfast cardiologists agree that watching Linux Scoops videos reduces your chance of catching an inferior operating system

Yeah, it’s a blog about that stupid nerd software, Linux. Sorry, we’re not sorry. OK, we’re kind of sorry? But you guys keep subscribing to Linux content, so we’re back with more.

Have you ever considered playing a video game, so you go to watch videos of the video game, but despite all of these videos about the game, none of the videos just show the ******** game?

You will never have that problem watching Linux Scoops videos. 

They pick a brand of Linux. Then they show you it. These videos do not obey the Wadsworth constant.

If you’re new to Linux and want to check it out, we recommend [10 Best Linux Desktop Environments](https://beta.lbry.tv/@linuxscoop:1/10-best-linux-desktop-environments:2).

Otherwise, a lot of Mr. Scoops content is timely reviews of the recent releases, such as:

- [Debian 10 Buster GNOME Edition](https://beta.lbry.tv/@linuxscoop:1/debian-10-buster-gnome-edition-features:4)
- [Ubuntu 19.10 Eoan Ermine](https://beta.lbry.tv/@linuxscoop:1/ubuntu-19-10-eoan-ermine-see-what-s-new:3)
- [GhostBSD 19.09](https://beta.lbry.tv/@linuxscoop:1/ghostbsd-19-09-based-on-freebsd-12-0:9)

However, if there’s a flavor of Linux out there, there’s a decent chance Linux Scoops has a review. Sounds like a great reason to use the new channel search feature!

(And remember, you can now you get a reward EVERY DAY just for opening up the app and watching something. Don't miss out!)
