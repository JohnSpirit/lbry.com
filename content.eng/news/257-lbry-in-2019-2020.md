How was your year, everyone? Ours was… okay.

Before we begin our annual review, let’s go ahead and knock out the sentence that’s been in [this thing three years running](https://lbry.com/news/lbry-in-2018-2019).

Our token price is irrelevant compared to what actually matters: building and marketing a technology that solves problems and is a joy to use.

By that metric, LBRY had it’s best year yet, and by a pretty absurd percent: our **weekly user numbers are up about 20x year-over-year**.

As lbry.tv has made it easier to embed and show video content to everyone, we're moving away from written blog posts to video content for our yearly review and roadmap announcement.
