Dads need to ask different things about their products. What happens when this is put into a mouth? Hit with a foam bat? Doused in orange juice? OK, so far as we can tell, none of these things actually happens in a [@DadReviews](https://open.lbry.com/@DadReviews:6) video (editors note: they should) and this dad was mildly disappointed.

But then he stuck around and found that @DadReviews offers reliable, relatable, and straightforward reviews of a variety of household items.
