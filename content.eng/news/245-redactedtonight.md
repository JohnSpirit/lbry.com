You won’t regret reading this fitting message about Camp (Lee Camp), the intermittently comedic and serious star of [Redacted Tonight.](https://lbry.tv/@RedactedTonight:c)

Redacted Tonight says they’re the most radical political comedy show in America. We’re only a few episodes in, but we can’t disagree.

Lee Camp exhibits an expansive range in his videos, so we’ll offer a corresponding menu:

- [The New Attack on Women](https://lbry.tv/@RedactedTonight:c/the-new-attack-on-women-web-exclusive:6)

- [Everything They Don’t Want You to Know About the Last Year](https://lbry.tv/@RedactedTonight:c/everything-they-don-t-want-you-to-know:0)

- [CNN Accidentally Has Worst Guest Ever](https://lbry.tv/@RedactedTonight:c/cnn-accidentally-has-worst-guest-ever:9) (Lee regularly dunks on CNN, try searching CNN for on his channel page for more of these)

As a comedian that doesn’t walk on eggshells, Lee has sometimes felt the wrath of YouTube and other censors for his art. [Please follow and support his channel on LBRY!](https://lbry.tv/@RedactedTonight:c)
