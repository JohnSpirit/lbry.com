## LBRY Doppler is LIVE in the Android Play Store
Today, LBRY releases LBRY Doppler, which brings notifications to the LBRY Android app.

[Download from Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.lbry.browser) / [Direct download](https://github.com/lbryio/lbry-android/releases/download/0.11.0/browser-0.11.0-release__arm64.apk)

Doppler allows you to receive notifications about your subscriptions, content interests, and rewards. Each of these can be individually toggled in your Settings page.

Notifications will be slowly rolled out and turned on in the coming weeks, but as an initial test of the system, everyone will be sent a notification with a special code over the next 24 hours. So make sure youâ€™re up to date!
