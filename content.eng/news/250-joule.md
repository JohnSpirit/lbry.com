## Introducing a High-Energy Homepage, Improved ERGonomics, and More Changes that Will Make You Say Watt?!

Today, LBRY releases LBRY Joule for Windows, macOS, and Linux. This new release adds a brand new homepage, improved navigation, and more.

- [Download Joule for desktop](https://lbry.com/get) 
- [Use LBRY in your browser](https://lbry.tv)

The new homepage brings larger tiles and offers a mix of content, rather than a single, specific view. The homepage view will look different depending on the number of channels and tags you follow. In general, the navigation has made it easier and clearer how to get back to content you like, as well as content you create.

A typical homepage view might show:

- Latest content from channels you follow
- Trending for tags you follow
- Content trending across the network
- Content tagged #homepagecagematch
- Latest from @lbry channel

We expect to add further customization of the homepage in future updates.

LBRY Joule also includes a revamped Invites area as part of a larger update to Invites for lbry.tv account holders. This will be shared in more detail in a separate announcement, but you are welcome to check it out and use them now.
