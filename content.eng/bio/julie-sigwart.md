Julie brings a unique background including a long history of software development, is a cartoonist, and is also a First Amendment champion. In 1988, the Hustler v. Falwell ruling was a major event in free speech history and has been a major influence for her. As an editorial cartoonist, she appreciates the gravity of that ruling to protect free speech, including speech that may be unpopular. In the early 2000’s, she founded Take Back the Media, a website dedicated to calling out mainstream news media for bias, omissions, and factual inaccuracies. Aside from receiving death threats (another consequence associated with free speech), Julie and Take Back The Media were sued in a SLAPP (Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation designed to chill free speech) for publishing contested information involving Michael Savage, Roy Masters, and Talk Radio Network. Ultimately, the lawsuit was withdrawn by the plaintiff, but it set Julie on a course to assist others who have been targeted in SLAPP suits attempting to shut down their free speech.

She is also a veteran of the dotcom era, including managing internet communities for Metacreations Corp, including support forums, gaming forums, and general chat support. She has also worked on and supported Metacreations Corp software titles like Kai’s Power Tips, Kai’s Power Tools, Kai’s Power Photos, and Stephen Hawking’s Life in the Universe product website.
